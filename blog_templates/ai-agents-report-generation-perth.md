> Traditionally we could only search for files based on their filename. But with AI we search and retrieve documents based on context, reducing manual search time.

"Find me the meeting notes where we discussed AI polic."

### Tools

- **Microsoft365 Copilot**: Searches within Office documents, teams chats, emails and more.
- **Vector Databases**: If you develop your own AI applications, you can use vector databases to find similar documents, providing them to other agents as part of a larger pipeline.

## 2. Deep Research: AI-Powered Information Gathering 🔍
